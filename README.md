## Growing Attributed Networks through Local Processes

This repository contains code to generate graphs via the Attributed Random Walk (ARW) model. ARW is a network growth model that explains how key structural properties of attributed networks can jointly emerge from a resource-constrained edge formation process. All datasets used in our experiments and analysis are available via this [link](https://uofi.box.com/s/rqohjojk2rjvbgfo7vfhaqb6hhmxrre9) in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) format.  You can learn more about our work by reading our [blog post](https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/networks/2019/06/06/Growing-Attributed-Networks/), [poster](/images/ARW/2019_www_arw_poster.pdf), [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3313640), and [arXiv manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.10195).
